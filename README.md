This process will run in the foreground. If you need to daemonize, use
start-stop-script, daemontools, supervisord, upstart, systemd, or your
preferred service watchdog.

By default statsrelay binds to 127.0.0.1:8125 for statsd proxying, and
it binds to 127.0.0.1:2003 for carbon proxying.

For each line that statsrelay receives in the statsd format
"statname.foo.bar:1|c\n", the key will be hashed to determine which
backend server the stat will be relayed to. If no connection to that
backend is open, the line is queued and a connection attempt is
started. Once a connection is established, all queued metrics are
relayed to the backend and the queue is emptied. If the backend
connection fails, the queue persists in memory and the connection will
be retried after one second. Any stats received for that backend during
the retry window are added to the queue.

Each backend has its own send queue. If a send queue reaches
`max-send-queue` bytes (default: 128MB) in size, new incoming stats
are dropped until a backend connection is successful and the queue
begins to drain.

All log messages are sent to syslog with the INFO priority.

Upon SIGHUP, the config file will be reloaded and all backend
connections closed. Note that any stats in the send queue at the time
of SIGHUP will be dropped.

If SIGINT or SIGTERM are caught, all connections are killed, send
queues are dropped, and memory freed. statsrelay exits with return
code 0 if all went well.

To retrieve server statistics, connect to TCP port 8125 and send the
string "status" followed by a newline '\n' character. The end of the
status output is denoted by two consecutive newlines "\n\n"

stats example:
```
$ echo status | nc localhost 8125

global bytes_recv_udp gauge 0
global bytes_recv_tcp gauge 41
global total_connections gauge 1
global last_reload timestamp 0
global malformed_lines gauge 0
backend:127.0.0.2:8127:tcp bytes_queued gauge 27
backend:127.0.0.2:8127:tcp bytes_sent gauge 27
backend:127.0.0.2:8127:tcp relayed_lines gauge 3
backend:127.0.0.2:8127:tcp dropped_lines gauge 0
```

## Config Options

There are a few options you can use to control the behavior of statsrelay, which
can be set in `/etc/statsrelay.yaml`. Here is a minimal config:

```yaml
carbon:
  bind: 127.0.0.1:9085
  tcp_cork: true
  validate: true
  shard_map:
    0: 10.10.10.10:9085
```

Besides the `bind` and `shard_map` settings (explained elsewhere), here is what
the boolean options do:

 * `tcp_cork` enabled the `TCP_CORK` option on TCP sockets; it's enabled by
   default and in many cases will significantly decrease the number of small TCP
   sockets that statsrelay emits (at a small penalty of up to 200ms latency in
   some cases).
 * `validate` tries to validate incoming data before forwarding it to statsd or
   carbon; it's on by default

## Scaling With Virtual Shards

Statsrelay implements a virtual sharding scheme, which allows you to
easily scale your statsd and carbon backends by reassigning virtual
shards to actual statsd/carbon instance or servers. This technique
also applies to alternative statsd implementations like statsite.

Consider the following simplified example with this config file:

```yaml
statsd:
  bind: 127.0.0.1:8125
  validate: true
  shard_map:
    0: 10.0.0.1:9000
    1: 10.0.0.1:9000
    2: 10.0.0.1:9001
    3: 10.0.0.1:9001
    4: 10.0.0.2:9000
    5: 10.0.0.2:9000
    6: 10.0.0.2:9001
    7: 10.0.0.2:9001
carbon:
  ...
```

In this file we've defined two actual backend hosts (10.0.0.1 and
10.0.0.2). Each of these hosts is running two statsd instances, one on
port 9000 and one on port 9001 (this is a good way to scale statsd,
since statsd and alternative implementations like statsite are
typically single threaded). In a real setup, you'd likely be running
more statsd instances on each server, and you'd likely have more
repeated lines to assign more virtual shards to each statsd
instance. At Uber we use 4096 virtual shards, with a much smaller
number of actual backend instances.

Internally statsrelay assigns a zero-indexed virtual shard to each
line in the file; so 10.0.0.1:9000 has virtual shards 0 and 1,
10.0.0.1:9001 has virtual shards 2 and 3, and so on.

Let's say that the backend server 10.0.0.1 has become overloaded, and
we want to add a new server to the configuration. We might do that
like this:

```yaml
statsd:
  bind: 127.0.0.1:8125
  validate: true
  shard_map:
    0: 10.0.0.1:9000
    1: 10.0.0.3:9000
    2: 10.0.0.1:9001
    3: 10.0.0.3:9001
    4: 10.0.0.2:9000
    5: 10.0.0.2:9000
    6: 10.0.0.2:9001
    7: 10.0.0.2:9001
carbon:
  ...
```

In the new configuration we've moved one of the two virtual shards for
10.0.0.1:9000 to 10.0.0.3:9000, and we've moved one of the two virtual
shards for 10.0.0.1:9001 to 10.0.0.3:9001. In other words, we've
reassigned the mapping for virtual shard 1 and virtual shard 3. Note
that when you do this, you want to maintain the same number of virtual
shards always, so you probably want to pick a large number of virtual
shards to start (say, 1024 virtual shards, meaning the configuration
file should have 1024 lines). You should have many duplicated lines in
the config file when you do this.

To do optimal shard assignment, you'll want to write a program that
looks at the CPU usage of your shards and figures out the optimal
distribution of shards. How you do that is up to you, but a good
technique is to start by generating a statsrelay config that has many
virtual shards evenly assigned, and then periodically have a script
that finds which actual backends are overloaded and reassigns some of
the virtual shards on those hosts to less loaded hosts (or to new
hosts).

If you don't initially assign enough virtual shards and then later
expand to more, everything will work, but data migration for carbon
will be a bit trickier; see below.

## A Note On Carbon Scaling

Statsrelay can do relaying for carbon lines just like statsd. The
strategy for scaling carbon using virtual shards is exactly the
same. One important difference, however, is that when you move a
carbon shard you'll want to move the associated whisper files as
well. You can do this using the `stathasher` binary that is built by
statsrelay. By pointing that command at your statsrelay config, you
can send it key names on stdin and have the virtual shard ids printed
to stdout.

Using this technique you can script the reassignment of whisper
files. The general idea is to walk the filesystem and gather all of
the unique keys stored in carbon backends on a host. You can then get
an idea for how expensive each virtual shard is based on the storage
space, number of whisper files, and possibly I/O metrics for each
virtual shard. By gathering the weights for each virtual shard on a
host, you can figure out the optimal way to redistribute the mapping
of virtual shards to actual carbon backends.

Note that when you move carbon instances, you also probably want to
migrate the whisper files as well. This ensures that you retain
historical data, and that graphite will get the right answer if it
queries multiple carbon backends. You can migrate the whisper files by
rsyncing the files you've identified as belonging to a moved virtual
shard using the `stathasher` binary described above. Remember to take
care to ensure that the old whisper files are deleted on the old host.
